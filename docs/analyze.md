# Analyze results

Results can be graphically analyzed with the `qplot` Python package located in the `python` folder.
Refer to the documentation within the package itself.
Documentation in IPython or Jupyter Notebooks/Lab can also be accessed using the `?` command, e.g. `qplot.density?`

Low-level data reading is available in the `resread` package.

The `qplot` package depends on the `matplotlib` and `numpy` packages; `resread` depends only on `numpy`.
